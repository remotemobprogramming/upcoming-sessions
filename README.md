# Remote mob programming sessions

These past couple of weeks I've participated in several [remote mob programming sessions](https://mobprogramming.org), many of them facilitated by [Woody Zuill](https://twitter.com/woodyzuill/) himself. I've learned plenty of cool stuff in those sessions and they have [profoundly influenced the way I think about software development](https://www.togetherwecode.com/articles/remote-team-failure-mob-programming-rescue/). Now I'm hungry for more!

Luckily, many others have started to organize similar sessions. If the idea of improving your skills and meeting other developers excites you, you should join one of those sessions.

- If you want to **get updated about future sessions**, make sure to watch this repository.
- If you're **hosting a session** feel free to raise a pull request and your session to this list.

Looking forward to be mob programming with you.
